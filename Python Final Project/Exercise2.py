2. Create a Lotto game:
 Puts in a list of 6 numbers, between 1-37, as in a real lottery.
 The numbers must not be repeated.
 Each game (row) in Lotto costs 3 ILS, Insert how much money do you have?
 Random 6 numbers â€“ the winner's number.
 Then play few rounds (rows) as your budget can handle.
 On each round, random 6 numbers , between 1-37, and check if you won.
 In the end sum the entire prize from all rounds.

If you guess:
6 numbers = won 1M ILS
5 numbers = won 5000 ILS
4 numbers = won 100 ILS
3 numbers = won 10 ILS
